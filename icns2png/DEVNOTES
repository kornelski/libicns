===============================================================================Developers notes for libicns 0.0.9 - February 15th, 2008Copyright (C) 2001-2008 Mathew Eis <mathew@eisbox.net>===============================================================================libicns currently provides two data structures and five functions formanipulating icns data. These are futher documented at the location of thier definitions and prototypes near the end of icns.hThe naming conventions used here will almost certainly change before therelease of libicns 0.1.0, however, the binary data structures are gauranteedto remain the same.===============================================================================Data Structurestypedef struct icns_element_ttypedef struct icns_family_ttypedef struct icns_image_tNote about the data in icns_image_t - if the bit-depth is less than 8 bits, thedata will be a squashed stream. i.e. for 1 bit data, one byte is actually 8pixels, that is, 11111111, for 4 bit data, one byte is two pixels, 0xF 0xFIn 32-bit data, the data stream is in ARGB order by defaultIn addition, the 4 and 8 byte images are encoded using the palettes found inthe file colormaps.hSee icns.h for more information===============================================================================Functions-------------------------------------------------------------------------------GetICNSImageFromICNSElement- Retreives an icon image from an icns element. Data is returned by- reference in an icns image object with raw, decoded, uncompressed data-------------------------------------------------------------------------------GetICNSElementFromICNSFamily- Retreives an icns element of the requested type from an icns family resourceGetICNSFamilyFromFileData- Retreives an icns family from a file. Note that if the file is in raw icns- format, this essentially means copying the file data to a location in- memory. Many icns files, however, are stored as rsrc files, do more decoding- is usually necessaryGetICNSFamilyFromMacResource- Primarily for internal use. Parses a Macintosh rsrc data set and retrieves- the first 'icns' resource found. Note that it is technically possible for- there to be more than one resource of type 'icns'.ParseMacBinaryResourceFork- Again primarily for internal use. Parses MacBinary data into Macintosh- rsrc data. Some icns files are stored within macbinary encoded rsrc filesSee icns.h for reference on the actual parameters used in these functions.===============================================================================Endianness issuesThe 'icns' icon family type has been in existence since the Mac 68k. The datastored within the files is, therefore, big-endian native. From experience, itseems unclear whether we are guaranteed this to be the case.There are currently two algorithms in place to handle and detect endianess:1) We check the file header, which ought to be 'icns'. If the header is   found to contain the bytes 'snci', we assume we need to swap bytes.2) We use a run-time check against known constants to determine the   endianess of the current system. The result of the routines are used   to parse the MacBinary format.The current definitive documentation on the issue seems to be found in theApple Developer Connection document "Guidelines for Swapping Bytes" from"Universal Binary Programming Guidelines Second Edition" - see as follows:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------Be aware of which functions return big-endian data, and use them appropriately.These include the BSD Sockets networking functions, the DNSServiceDiscoveryfunctions (for example, TCP and UDP ports are specified in network byte order),and the ColorSync profile functions (for which all data is big-endian). TheIconFamilyElement and IconFamilyResource data types (which also include thedata types IconFamilyPtr and IconFamilyHandle) are always big-endian. Theremay be other functions and data types that are not listed here. Consult theappropriate API reference for information on data returned by a function.
